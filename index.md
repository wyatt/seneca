A small, unofficial python API for SenecaLearning. This in a *beta stage* so please be prepared for bugs and issues. If anyone from SenecaLearning is reading this, a way to drastically improve this project is to introduce a way to create API keys. I am a student so updates may be erractic, but I hope to keep it as up to date as I can. If you can help improve this project in any way - create a pull request! I'm sure there's things I should be doing better and/or differently.
